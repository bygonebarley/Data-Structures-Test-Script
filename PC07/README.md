README for test scripts

In order to run the scripts properly, PC07 must take two arguments, an input filename and an output file name. The input file will only contain the different pins with each new pin being on its own separate line. The output file will only contain the generated password from PC07.

Keep the python file and bash script in the PC07 subdirectory. 

Example Input File:

352
154
542
152

Example Output File:

31542

( The output file should include a new line character at the end )

Example PC07 call:

exe/./PC07 tests/test1.txt test1.out
